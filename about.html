        <h2> Our Mission </h2> 
        <p> A better world is a kinder world.
        </p>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Our world is divided, especially to those who are different than we are or have different opinions than ones we carry. It’s always been this way, and the divided nature does ebb and flow throughout history, but our country is divided now in a way that many of us have not seen in our lifetimes. 
            <div class="work">Let’s work on this together. </div>
            Together we can create a world where kindness outshines hatred. This is the inspiration behind The Kind Deed Project, spreading kindness and cheer to all. 
        
        <h2>
        How Does It work? </h2>
        <p>
        The kind deeds that we are sharing with you on our webpage and emailed newsletter are an attempt to spread some kindness both at home and away from home. For each daily task you complete, you get a reward (one entry in our contest per day and a virtual gift). At the end of the year, we’ll randomly draw a name from all the entries and that person gets the grand prize: ____.</p>

              <h2>JJ Bryant</h2>
              <p>JJ Bryant is a former English teacher from Pulaski County, Kentucky. After an educator trip to China where she caught typhus, legionellas, AND one of the coxsackieviruses, she stepped away from the middle school classroom, went back to school for accounting, and became a tax preparer. Now she is aiming for her third career as a Junior Web Developer (ready for work immediately or after the 2022 tax season). JJ is a mother of two sons: Tyler (a coach and teacher in Pulaski County) and Matthew (a hopeful Spring 2022 Commonwealth Coder). With the Sept. 9th, 2021 birth of their son Lukas, Tyler and wife Rachel recently made JJ a young grandma. JJ likes spending time with family, reading, genealogy, trivia, archeology, and science fiction, especially Isaac Asimov and Octavia Butler...and Octavia Sexton...and Octavia Spencer...all the Octavias, ok.  </p>
