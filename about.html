            <h2> Our Mission </h2> 
            <p> A better world is a kinder world.
            </p>
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Our world is divided, especially to those who are different than we are or have different opinions than ones we carry. It’s always been this way, and the divided nature does ebb and flow throughout history, but our country is divided now in a way that many of us have not seen in our lifetimes. 
                <div class="work">Let’s work on this together. </div>
                Together we can create a world where kindness outshines hatred. This is the inspiration behind The Kind Deed Project, spreading kindness and cheer to all. 
            
            <h2>
            How Does It work? </h2>
            <p>
            The kind deeds that we are sharing with you on our webpage and emailed newsletter are an attempt to spread some kindness both at home and away from home. For each daily task you complete, you get a reward (one entry in our contest per day and a virtual gift). At the end of the year, we’ll randomly draw a name from all the entries and that person gets the grand prize: ____.</p>
